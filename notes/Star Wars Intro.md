# Star Wars Intro in Vim

Created by [Damian Conway](https://github.com/thoughtstream)

Download from [SWTC.vim](https://github.com/shinokada/SWTC.vim)

## Installation

Using NeoBundle, add the following to your .vimrc

    NeoBundle 'shinokada/SWTC.vim'

When you save .vimrc, NeoBundle is clever enough to download SWTC.vim.

## Prepare

Use set nonumber in your .vimrc or from normal mode input

    :set nonumber

Check your pwd

    :pwd

## To use

Then use this to start.

    # if your pwd is SWTC.vim
    :SWTC ./intro.swtc
    # if somewhere else
    :SWTC /path/to/.vim/bundle/SWTC.vim/intro.swtc

## Modify

Modify intro.swtc.
